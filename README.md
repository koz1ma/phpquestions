3 tasks for dev test
You should be able to run task 1 and 3 by just cloning the folders on your PHP server and accessing Solver.php and LotteryDate.php
Folder for task 2 contain the SQL to create the data and insert some dummy data for testing. You should configure the db credentials on database.php to be able to run User.php
